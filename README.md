# 385Module2

This file contains classes for the assignment in Module 2 of CSC 385. To run the program in the VSCode, simply click on the main.py file and run the file. In the terminal, you will be prompted with the Inventory Management System, which consists of adding, updating, deleting, and viewing inventory. There are also extra features, such as searching a product by name and checking for low stock on items. The program also has exception handling for quantiy and price by checking to make sure the values entered are numbers.


DIRECTIONS FOR THE PROGRAM
1. To run the program in the VSCode, simply click on the main.py file and run the file.
2. In the terminal, you will see a list of features that the program is capable of doing. Enter the corresponding number for the function you would like to use.
3. You will notice that there are sample items already created within the inventory system (for example purposes). To remove them, simply use the delete product feature.
4. Once you are done with the system and are back on the menu, press 5 to exit the program. The program will be closed, and you may relaunch the program to try it again.
5. You will find a test_inventory file. This file is not necessary to run the program, it is only used for testing purposes.

*****NOTE: Any changes made while the program is running will NOT be saved. This is for demo purposes only.



I would like to summarize how I used Copilot to help complete this assignment.


 Firstly, I used the o1-mini model when creating prompts. My list of prompts include, "Annotate code from all files", "Run the program and check for any issues", "Write a unit test for this method... (used on multiple methods)" and "Check the efficiency of all files and make suggestions for any improvements". When making the methods, I found that autofill was surprisingly good at creating the methods I was about to type out. I also used it to resolve any problems VSCode detected while writing the program by copying the errors that were detected and having Copilot scan the files for potential issues. Using the in-line version of Copilot was finnicky and did not always have a solution for the issue that was present (in some cases, it made it worse). Once the program was running correctly, I used copilot to check for any efficiency issues that could minimize the amount of code that was used. I found that when you have Copilot examine the file folder as a whole rather than each individual file, it was better at finding errors and changes that could be made to multiple files at once. As a final check, I had Copilot write a unit test that ensures all the files passed general tests (the test inventory file is included with this but is not necessary for the program to run).

Thanks for checking out my code!
