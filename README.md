# 385Module2

This file contains classes for the assignment in Module 2 of CSC 385. To run the program in the VSCode, simply click on the main.py file and run the file. In the terminal, you will be prompted with the Inventory Management System, which consists of adding, updating, deleting, and viewing inventory. There are also extra features, such as searching a product by name and checking for low stock on items. Once you are done with the system and are back on the menu, press 5 to exit the program. The program will be closed, and you may relaunch the program to try it again.

I would like to summarize how I used Copilot to help complete this assignment. Firstly, I used the o1-mini model for a majority of this assignmnet. I used it to write some methods in inventory, annotate code in all files, and for testing purposes. I also used it to resolve any problems VSCode detected while writing the program. Once the program was running correctly, I used copilot to check for any efficiency issues that could minimize the amount of code that was used. I found that when you have Copilot examine the file folder as a whole rather than each individual file, it was better at finding errors and changes that could be made to multiple files at once. To do this, any changes I made to the main branch in Github, and would ask Copilot to search my codebase for the files that I was working on.


*****NOTE: Any changes made while the program is running will NOT be saved. This is for demo purposes only.
